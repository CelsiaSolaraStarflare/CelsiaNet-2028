# CelsiaNet-2028
Proceeding into Pre-Release of CelsiaNet 2.0 ðŸ˜Š


CelsiaNet is a project that I have been working on since 2019, and the two version I have already are CvELSIA and CelsiaNet 2024. Right now we are making CelsiaNet 2024 currently private in order to arrange the files and model structure so that it is easily replicatable. Most importantly, we have a new technique and modules that we want to integrate back into CelsiaNet 2024, so that it can compile upon our own lightweighted architecture. Not that we don't want to continue to use LLAVA or BLIP, but we want to maximize the compatibility of our model to align with other specific modules, and making our own base architecture would help resolve this issue.

Proceeding into CelsiaNet 2028, we would want to see a even more lightweighted (probably 4.2B -> 3.0B) model with same or higher metrics. Moreover, we want to synthesis autolearning during inference to the model, so that it can learn something during run and not only after collecting and training process. We believe the alignment process could definitly be trained on during inference, as it does not significantly change the outcome, but make all of the modules run in sync and make the alignment process faster (if we get a good mapping we could swap it with an even more lightweight static model).

Why 2028? You might expect CelsiaNet to come out in 2026 since the last two version all cross by two years. But no... We are releasing something bigger, and something that is a distance away from computer vision but also requiring this model. More likely, CelsiaNet 2024 is her mentor right now as we train during progress! One giveaway that we can tell you is that her name is SerenaNet 2025, and she has a pretraining stage using the outputs of CelsiaNet 2024. Hence, we look forward on having a multimodal framework this year!

How about CelsiaNet 2028?
Yup we will continue to build it during the end of highschool and into university, but since higher metrics would mean higher difficulty and higher stability, I pardon another two year gap (2025 to 2027) so that we can get everything (including the machines and lab that we are using) to be in set, and that we could have a stable workstation for inventing. SerenaNet, on the other hand, is the last network that I will release during highschool, and following with the theoretical FionaFrame V comming in 2026.

Hence if you are excited, please await for SerenaNet 2025!
